    Estimates solar system cost and monthly payment based on electricity usage and home size.

    Inputs:
        area_kwh_month (float): user's average monthly electricity usage in kWh
        home_sqft (float): size of the home in square feet
        cost_per_watt (float): installed cost per watt ($/W). If None, uses national average.

        loan_years (int): loan term duration in years
        tax_credit (float): federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) portion (e.g., 0.30 for 30%)
